# DSP48A
Implementation of a DSP48A sliceâ€“based design in Verilog, demonstrating high-speed arithmetic operations on Xilinx FPGAs. The project includes Verilog source files, testbenches for functional verification using QuestaSim, and a PDF report detailing the design methodology, synthesis results, and FPGA implementation in Vivado.
