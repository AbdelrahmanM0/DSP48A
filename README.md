# DSP48A
This project focuses on replicating the functionality of the DSP48A1 block using Verilog HDL, complemented by comprehensive simulation and functional verification in QuestaSim. After verification, the design was synthesized, implemented, and deployed on Xilinx hardware via Vivado, achieving timing closure and ensuring seamless hardware integration.

The work highlights my proficiency in FPGA-based digital signal processing, demonstrating the complete lifecycle of a hardware design â€” from concept and architectural planning through simulation, verification, synthesis, and final deployment. Delivering a fully operational, high-performance DSP module reinforced my expertise in building efficient, real-time processing systems and showcased my ability to translate a complex specification into a reliable, deployable FPGA solution.
